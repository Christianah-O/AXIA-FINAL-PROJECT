# Loan Default Prediction  

## Overview  
This project predicts whether a customer will **default on a loan (Yes/No)** using loan, demographic, and previous repayment data.  

## Steps  
- Cleaned and merged 3 datasets  
- Handled missing values and engineered features (loan counts, repayment delay, age, ratios)  
- Balanced the data using **SMOTE**  
- Trained models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, Gradient Boosting)  
- Tuned hyperparameters with GridSearchCV  
- Built a simple **Power BI dashboard** for visualization  

## Results  
- **Best Model**: Logistic Regression  
- Recall (Defaults) = **59%**  
- F1 (Defaults) = **42%**  
- Accuracy â‰ˆ **65%**  

## Tools  
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Imbalanced-learn)  
- Google Colab  
- Power BI
